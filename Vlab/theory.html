    </div>

    <div class="mx-5">
        <h4>Objective:</h4>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To determine the physical parameters such as turbidity, pH, and conductance of a water sample.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h4>Concept:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>It is needless to emphasize the importance of water in our life. Without water, there is no life on
                    our planet. We need water for different purposes. We need water for drinking, for industries, for
                    irrigation, for swimming and fishing, etc. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Water for different purposes has its own requirements as to composition and purity. Each body of
                    water needs to be analysed on a regular basis to confirm to suitability. The types of analysis could
                    vary from simple field testing for a single analyte to laboratory based multi-component instrumental
                    analysis. The measurement of water quality is a very exacting and time consuming process, and a
                    large number of quantitative analytical methods are used for this purpose.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Principle:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This method is based on a comparison of the intensity of light scattered by the sample under defined
                    conditions with the intensity of light scattered by a standard reference suspension under the same
                    conditions. The higher the intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity. Commonly used
                    primary standard reference suspension is Formazin polymer. The turbidity of a specified
                    concentration of formazin suspension is defined as 400 NTU.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Turbidity:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Turbidity is the amount of particulate matter that is suspended in water. Turbidity measures the
                    scattering effect that suspended solids have on light: the higher the intensity of scattered light,
                    the higher the turbidity.</p>
            </li>

        <h4>Material that causes water:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Silt</li>
            <li>Clay</li>
            <li>Finely divided organic and inorganic matter.</li>
            <li>Microscopic organisms.</li>
            <li>Plankton.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Apparatus:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Laboratory or process nephelometer consisting of a light source for illuminating the sample and one
                    or more photoelectric detectors with a readout device to indicate intensity of light scattered at
                    90º to the path of incident light.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sample cells: Use sample cells or tubes of clear, colourless glass or plastic. Keep cells
                    scrupulously clean, both inside and out, and discard if scratched or etched.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Reagents:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Diluation water:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>High-purity water will cause some light scattering, which is detected by nephelometers as
                            turbidity. To obtain low-turbidity water for dilutions, nominal value 0.02 NTU, pass
                            laboratory reagent-grade water through a filter with pore size sufficiently small to remove
                            essentially all particles larger than 0.1µm. The usual membrane filter used for
                            bacteriological examinations is not satisfactory. Rinse collecting flask at least twice with
                            filtered water and discard the next 200 mL.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Stock primary standard formazin suspension:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Solution (i):- Dissolve 1g hydrazinesulphate (NH2)2.H2SO4, in distilled water and dilute to
                            100 mL in a volumetric flask.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Solution (ii):- Dissolve 10.0g hexamethylenetetramine, (CH2)6N4, in distilled water and
                            dilute to 100mL in a volumetric flask.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> In flask, mix 5.0 mL solution (i) and 5.0 mL solution (ii). Let stand for 24 hr at 25± 3ºC.
                            This results in a 400-NTU suspension. Transfer stock suspension into an amber glass or other
                            UV-light-blocking bottle for storage. Make dilutions from this stock suspension. The stock
                            suspension is stable for up to 1 year when properly stored.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Dilute turbidity suspensions:- Dilute 400 NTU primary standard suspensions with high-quality
                            dilution water. Prepare immediately before use and after use.
                        </p>
                        <p>Working standards can be prepared by dilution of the following quantities of the stock
                            formazin turbidity suspension (nominal 400 NTU) to 200 mL.</p>
                    </li>

            <li>
                Second Standards:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Secondary standards are standards that the manufacturer has certified will give instrument
                            calibration results equivalent (within certain limits) to the results obtained when the
                            instrument is calibrated with the primary standard, i.e., the user-prepared formazin.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>General measurement techniques:- Proper measurement techniques are important in minimizing the
                    effects of instrument variables, as well as stray light and air bubbles. Regardless of the
                    instrument used, the measurement will be more accurate, precise, and repeatable if close attention
                    is paid to proper measurement techniques.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Nephelometer calibration:- Follow the manufacturer’s operating instructions. Run at least one
                    standard in each instrument range to be used. Make certain the nephelometer gives stable readings in
                    all sensitivity ranges used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Measurement of turbidity:- Gently agitate sample. Wait until air bubbles disappear and pour sample
                    into cell. When possible, pour well-mixed sample into cell and immerse it in an ultrasonic bath for
                    1 to 2 S or apply vacuum degassing, causing complete bubble release. Read turbidity directly from
                    instrument display.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Calibration of continuous turbidity monitors:- Calibrate continuous turbidity monitors for low
                    turbidities by determining turbidity of the water flowing out of them using a laboratory-model
                    nephelometer. Or calibrate the instruments according to manufacturer’s instructions with formazin
                    primary standard or appropriate secondary standard.</p>
            </li>
            <pre>pH=-log([H*])</pre>
            <li>
                <p>Practically every phase of water supply and waste water treatment such as water softening, acid-base
                    neutralization, coagulation, precipitation, disinfectant and corrosion control is pH dependent. The
                    pH of a water sample measures its hydrogen ion concentration and indicates whether the sample is
                    acidic, neutral or basic.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>pH:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>pH may be measured accurately using a pH meter. The pH meter must be calibrated before making pH
                    measurements. For calibration standard buffers of pH 4.00, 7.00 and 10.00 are used. pH of water
                    indicates the hydrogen ion concentration in water. The concept of pH was put forward by Sorenson in
                    1909. It is expressed as the logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion concentration in
                    moles/litre at a given temperature. While the alkalinity or acidity measures the total resistance to
                    the pH change or buffering capacity, the pH gives the hydrogen ion activity. The pH scale extends
                    from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline) with 7 corresponding to exact neutrality at 25ºC. pH is
                    used in the calculation of carbonate, bicarbonate and CO2, corrosion, stability index etc. </p>

        <h4>Electrical Conductivity:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Electrical conductivity (EC) is a measure of how conductive the water is to electrical current.
                    Greater the ion concentration, greater is the EC. Generally higher the EC, higher is the total
                    dissolved solids. Electrical Conductivity is an indirect measure for finding the total dissolved
                    solids in a water body. To convert the electrical conductivity of a water sample (micro Siemens per
                    cm, μS/cm) to the concentration of total dissolved solids (ppm), the conductivity must be multiplied
                    by a factor between 0.46 and 0.9 (depending on the unique mixture of the dissolved materials). A
                    widely accepted conversion factor is 0.67. TDS (ppm) = Conductivity { (μS/cm) x 0.67}.The instrument
                    used for measuring conductivity is conductivity meter.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Determination of cell constant:- Rinse conductivity cell with at least three portions of 0.01 M KCl
                    solution. Adjust temperature of fourth portions to 25.0º±0.1ºC. If a conductivity meter displays
                    resistance, R ohms, measure resistance of this portion and note temperature. Compute cell constant,
                    C.</p>
            </li>
            <pre>C, cm-1 = (0.001412) (RKCl) [1+0.0191(t-25)].</pre>
            <li>Conductivity measurement:- Thoroughly rinse cell with one or more portions of sample. Adjust temperature
                of a final portion to about 25ºC. Measure sample resistance of conductivity and note temperature to
                ±0.1ºC.</li>
